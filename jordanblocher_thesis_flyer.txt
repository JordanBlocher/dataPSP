Dynamical Systems: Chaotic Attractors and 
    Synchronization using Time-Averaged Partial
Observations of the Phase Space


We study the synchronization of chaotic systems when the coupling
between them contains both time averages and stochastic noise.
Our model dynamics are given by the Lorenz equations
which are a system of three ordinary differential
equations in the variables X, Y and Z.
Our theoretical results show that coupling two copies of the
Lorenz equations using a feedback control which consistes
of time averages of the X variable
leads to exact synchronization provided the
time-averaging window is known and sufficiently small.
In the precense of noise the convergence is to within a
factor of the variance of the noise.
We also consider the case when the time-averaging window
is not known and show that it is possible to tune the
feedback control to recover the size of the
time-averaging window.
Further numerical computations
show that synchronization is more accurate and occurs
under much less stringent conditions than our theory requires.
